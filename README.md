# Portfolio

## Description
In this assignment we are building a portfolio website from scratch. We are to code out our HTML and link the CSS sheet to it. The portfolio we build should look the example given to us. It should look almost exact to the website provided but with our own "about me" section. Also, the links in the footer should link to our own socials.
